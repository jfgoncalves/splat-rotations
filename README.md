  It does not update itself so make sure to check manually every once and a while.

* **Safari:**<br>
  In June 2015, Apple announced the merging of their developer plans. [Developing for Safari was free before](http://gizmodo.com/apples-great-new-developer-program-screws-over-safari-d-1710539882), but as of now it cost 99$/y. Splat Rotations was initially planned for Safari, but I will not pay that much money to develop a free browser extension. **So, no support for Safari is planned.** If you are a developer with access to the Apple Developer Program, you can fork my project and port the code.
